### This is a spotify clone 
# Written with modern React with Hooks

This application was written to better my skills in react hooks and to make a enjoyable app that is fully functional. 

To run this application you will need to replace the contextID (in Body), clientID (in spotify).

Once you have changed those two values you can run:
## npm i
## npm start
